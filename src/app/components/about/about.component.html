    <div class="section-title">about me</div>
    <p>I'm a builder.</p>
    <p>From building birdhouses with my grandpa as a kid, to gluing pipe in the field, to installing solar on roofs, to writing code, I get stuff done.</p>
    <p>Back in 2012, I started my coding journey by writing my own Excel macros from scrath. At first doing simple tasks like auto-sorting as the user entered data, to eventually creating full-fledged applications written in VBA with Excel simply acting only as the UI. The scope of my projects kept growing including report generators, project trackers, assest management dashboards, sales tools, you name it. Anything I could build to make my company more efficient. My largest VBA project is my senior project at Cal Poly in which I creating an irrigation design platform, integrating fluid dynamic calculations form my years studying as a BRAE, minor in water science.</p>
    <p>I picked up some matlab, C and python in college, but I didn't really start devloping until I started my role as an Analytics Engineer at Geli. It is here that I would build cutting-edge tools to analyze battery revenue streams across the world and help make green energy a viable option.</p>
    <p>Growing out of the analytics shoes I was filling, I migrated to a UI Engineer position through the acquisition of the company by QCells. It is in this role that I have truly been able to leverage my years of building applications as a sole developer and excel in grow our product suite with a team.</p>
